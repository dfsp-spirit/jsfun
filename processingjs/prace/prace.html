<h1>PRace</h1>
<p>    
    <b>Controls:</b> Keep the left mouse button pressed to gain thrust, release button to fall.<br/>
    <b>Gameplay:</b> Survive as long as possible, i.e., avoid crashing into enemies or walls.<br/>
    <b>Hints:</b> 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Flying close to enemies gives higher scores per second (indicated by white line).</li>	
	<li>The required minimum distance for higher score (negatively) depends on the size of the enemy, i.e., it is easier with larger enemies.</li>
	<li>Green enemies are very small, and flying close to them gives twice the score of blue ones.</li>
	<li>Slightly overlapping with enemies given even higher score (cyan line), but beware: you die when your core touches the enemy (red line).</li>	
	</ul>
