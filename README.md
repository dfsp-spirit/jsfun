# jsfun
A collection of fun web stuff I played around with. Mostly visualizations in [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and [processing](http://processingjs.org/).


## Visualizations in action

- You can see my `liveplot` p5js script in action at the [p5js online editor website](https://editor.p5js.org/animationspirit/sketches/HywUTkBt7).
- You can try `PRace` live at [rcmd.org/projects/prace/](http://rcmd.org/projects/prace/).
